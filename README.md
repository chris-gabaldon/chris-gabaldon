# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Christopher Gabaldon

## About me and this site
IÂ´m an undergraduated student in physics at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA). Up to this date, at college, I have encountered various physics and statistics problems (from different branches) that I found interesting and solved numerically, mostly using Python, along with attaching the theoretical contents. In the last year IÂ´ve specialized in neural networks (using pytorch and sk-learning). Additionally, I have knowledge in SQL and HTML languages. In my repository, you will find these types of projects.

## Education
